# Pytorch_MuseGAN_HSEstudy
Study project for the HSE "Master of Data Science" program

The project is based on paper [MuseGAN: Multi-track Sequential Generative Adversarial Networks for Symbolic Music Generation and Accompaniment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06298) and GitHub [repository](https://github.com/akanametov/musegan)

The example of model usage is shown in [notebook](MuseGAN_example.ipynb)

The example of generated melody could be found in [notebook](https://github.com/rm1113/Pytorch_MuseGAN_HSEstudy/blob/main/MuseGAN_example.ipynb) and in the file fake_midi.midi
